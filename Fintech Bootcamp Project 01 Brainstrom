Our project is to help build a portfolio of Australian stocks that is able to weather black swan events.  We will example relationships how Australian sectors performed through the Covid Pandemic and Ukraine War, and find the best performing portfolio to weather these events.  Based on our analysis we will show which secto ofrs outperform benchmarks (**Choose benchmark**).
We will also use a keyword or sentiment analysis to analyse which sectors may have been oversold from the bottom to suggest investments during a black swan event.
What happened during times of stability.
